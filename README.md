Hello, Welcome to the Status Update Bot!
It is great to see you here.
Everyday you wish to see the status updates of some people, let it be your mentee/mentor. But searching for that particular mail is difficult in the thread\n
This bot helps you with that. All you have to do is to 'follow' whosever updates you want to get. This bot will send you their status updates to via Telegram chat!\n
The methods which are accessable to you are

*NOTE*: This is a public bot. To make sure that the wrong people do not get the status updates of the FOSS mailing list you are required to request access from the admin. All you have to do is send the /request_access command. Until the admin accepts your request, you will not be getting the status updates of others. But you can keep editing your preferences till then i.e you can add who to follow and not. Once the admin accepts your request, you will be getting a notification. Similary the admin can revoke your access at any point of time.
You will be receiving the status updates of the previous day daily at 5:10 AM
Please check if your mail is present in /list_all_mails
